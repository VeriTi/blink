Blink!
=====
**Fast covers import generator**
### How to use it
1. Download the appropriate version from [**here**](https://github.com/VeriTi/blink/releases/latest).
    * If you have 32-bit Windows, download 32-bit version.
    * If you have 64-bit Windows, download 64-bit version.
    * If you don't know, and you have Vista, 7 or 8, go to Start > Right-click **"Computer"** > Properties.
    * If you have XP, it's most likely 32-bit.
    * Or just use 32-bit version. It's slightly slower but works everywhere.
2. Run it.
    * It's okay to run it right from archive, but if you want to use it frequently, better extract it somewhere.
3. Enter your username into the box at the top.
4. Check the necessary list types (*Animelist* and/or *Mangalist*).
5. Select the appropriate selectors for your lists.
    * If you don't know what you need for your custom layout, it's usually mentioned at the post with it.
6. For each list type, click **Browse...** and choose where to save your covers file.
7. Click **Blink!** and wait for the message telling you it's finished.
